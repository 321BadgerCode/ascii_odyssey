The game is set in a world where magic and technology coexist, and the land is populated by various monsters such as goblins, trolls, and dragons. However, the monsters were once peaceful and coexisted with humans until a mysterious figure known as the Math Teacher rose to power.

The Math Teacher was once a respected member of society, known for their intelligence and teaching abilities. However, the Math Teacher became obsessed with the idea of creating a perfect society through the power of mathematics. They began to gather followers, including many of the monsters, and eventually seized control of the land.

As the chosen hero, you must venture forth and confront the Math Teacher, battling your way through hordes of monsters and eventually facing off against the Math Teacher themselves. Along the way, you will meet allies who will aid you in your quest, and enemies who will seek to stop you.
